## Saper
A window-based application of the classic Minesweeper game, which involves discovering individual fields on the board in such a way as not to encounter a mine. Each discovered field has a number of mines that are directly in contact with that field. You should use these numbers to deduce where the mines are hidden and discover all the fields without mines.
There are 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy - 50 mines, medium - 75 mines and difficult - 100 mines.
